Project Portfolio: Analyzing Kenyaâ€™s Fuel Prices across major towns for the past year.

Currently for the first time in history the fuel prices in Kenya went past the Ksh 200 mark($1.36) per liter affecting households as cost of goods increased while in the midst of a challenging economy being experienced.

The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) plays the role in determining fuel prices in Kenya. On a mid month basis, EPRA reviews and announces new fuel prices, which are then implemented for the next 15 days.
Problem statement
Analyzing the fuel prices in comparison to the dollar price over the period of 1 year across 5 major towns  (Nairobi,Mombasa,Kisumu,Nakuru and Eldoret) which are usually highlighted when EPRA announces new price change.
